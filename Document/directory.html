					Currently Enrolled on Computer Information Technology(CIT) on Lethbridge College.<br><br>
					Hello, My name is Ishor Bastola. I was born in Jhapa, Nepal. I had been living in Canada for 8 years. I like spending time on
					using computer, listening music, watching movies, playing soccer and hanging out with friends. Since from my childwood, I like using
					computers alot but there were no computer on school home, etc. We need to pay money (around Rs. 1000) for just going and learn only the basic
					part of computer like Microsoft word, Typing Tutor, etc. Well, in Nepal there is one big problem, when someone work they get less money
					and when we needs to buy anything like food, vegetables, etc. then its too expensive. We are refugee so, we can't afford lots of money for doing
					those things which we like. Days are passing and the government start taking the people to the America, Canada, etc. We fill up the form and
					apply it to come here. I was so happy when the day came that we are going to come here because we heard lots of things about this Country.
					We are here at October 8, 2009. When we were here then the snow is falling which I never had seen the snow before. I was like too much surprised
					and too much cold because there were too much hot in nepal. I started going to school, when I see the computers I really like to use it and I take
					some course on high school then I think from that time I will learn about computers on future. I am done high school at 2014 and work for a year and
					currently doing Computer Information Technology(CIT) on Lethbridge College and hope to go University for Computer Science.<br><br><br><br>
